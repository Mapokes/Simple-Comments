## Overview

### The challenge

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- Use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- Track the time of posted comments relative to currently logged user
- On page load if localstorage is empty for the site, it creates sample comments with sample currently logged user
- Logout, create new account (username has to be unique), login on existing account by typing username and password
- Display errors on empty fields, wrong password/username, too big size of an image
- New user can select their own avatar from pc files but its size can't be more than 100Kb.
